# Shop Assistant - Brought to you by GitHub Copilot Agent 
This is an experiment project to test the capabilities of GitHub Copilot Agent 

I am trying to see how much I can get out of the **GitHub Copilot Agent mode.** I'd like to document the prompt process, **from an initial big idea, to architecture design, to scaffolding code, and then to completed code modules and eventually, an working application with testing code.** This process may take some trial and error and refinement of prompts. I hope to be surprised and satisfied in the end. If this process works, we could use it for our future Projects. 

All my prompts will be posted to **docs/prompts** folder. 

When the code has been created, I will post the application folder structure with generated code. 

You are welcome to work with me on this project by clone this repo and make your branch. I created **docs/project_team_discussions** where you can upload your ideas and your prompts.
